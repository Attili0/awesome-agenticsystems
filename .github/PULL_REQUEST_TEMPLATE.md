## Checklist

Tick what applies. An unticked box tells the reviewer where to look and does
not block the merge.

**For an added or edited paper:**

- [ ] `area` describes the **contribution** of the paper, and not the topic it
      covers. (Several agents on their own means `scale: [multi-agent]`, not
      `area: coordination`.)
- [ ] `scale` reflects the scale of the system studied.
- [ ] The paper is absent from the collection under any other title.
- [ ] `id` matches the filename.
- [ ] A record with `status: read` carries `tldr`, `topics` and `about`.
      Otherwise it is `triaged`, which is a valid end state.
- [ ] `relates_to` is declared in **one direction only** (newer paper points at
      the older one). The reverse link is computed automatically.

**For a change to `src/data/taxonomy.yml`:**

- [ ] `npm run docs` has been run and the regenerated blocks are committed. CI
      fails otherwise, since the guides and the issue form are generated from
      that file.
- [ ] A new topic would serve as a filter *today*. A new area has at least one
      paper to live in it, and an argument from the literature in
      [TAXONOMY.md](../TAXONOMY.md#bibliographic-basis).

**For every pull request:**

- [ ] `npm run build` passes locally. CI runs it as well, so this step only
      saves a round trip.
- [ ] For a change under `scripts/`, `npm test` passes and any new behavior has
      a test. That directory runs unsupervised, and its failures reach
      contributors as issue comments.
