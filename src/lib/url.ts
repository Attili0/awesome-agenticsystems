/**
 * Internal links, always relative to the `base` in astro.config.mjs.
 *
 * The site is served under a subpath (/awesome-agenticsystems), so a bare
 * href of "/areas" 404s. That prefix used to be written by hand in ~20 places:
 * a fork, a repo rename or a change to `base` broke every internal link, and
 * the build never noticed, because to Astro they are just strings.
 *
 * BASE_URL may or may not carry a trailing slash depending on config, so we
 * normalise it.
 *
 *   url()                     -> "/awesome-agenticsystems/"
 *   url('/areas')             -> "/awesome-agenticsystems/areas"
 *   url(`/papers/${id}`)      -> "/awesome-agenticsystems/papers/react-2022"
